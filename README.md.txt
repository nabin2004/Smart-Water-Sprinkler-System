Smart Water Sprinkler Based on IoT

Smart Water Sprinkler

This repository contains the code and documentation for an intelligent water sprinkler system designed to control and manage dust particles, specifically PM2.5 (Particulate Material 2.5). The system utilizes IoT technology and sophisticated sensing capabilities to identify peak time intervals and target regions with high concentrations of dust. By spewing water in minute fragments, the smart water sprinkler effectively settles down the dust particles, resulting in cleaner and healthier air.

Abstract

This research article offers a thorough examination of the design and use of intelligent water sprinklers for the control and management of dust particles, especially PM2.5. Given the rising concern over air pollution and its harmful impact on human health, finding efficient ways to reduce dust particles present in the air is essential. With the use of IoT technology and sophisticated sensing capabilities, the suggested smart water sprinklers can identify peak time intervals and activate at the right time, targeting regions with a high concentration of dust. The sprinklers effectively settle down the dust particles by spewing water in minute fragments, resulting in cleaner, healthier air. The results emphasize the system's potential to help improve air quality and demonstrate the effectiveness of its prototype. The study concludes with suggestions for future developments and the use of intelligent water sprinklers for dust control.

Introduction

The health of people and the welfare of communities are significantly endangered by air pollution, a major environmental problem on a worldwide scale. This research focuses on the capital city of Nepal, Kathmandu, which has experienced rising air pollution levels and is one of the areas battling this problem. Kathmandu has the terrible title of being the most air-polluted city in the world, with PM2.5 concentration generally 5.8 times the WHO annual air quality guideline value. It is crucial to find creative and practical solutions to enhance the city's air quality and guarantee the welfare of its residents.
